title: Metis Week 1 -- Project Benson
---

My first week at Metis started off at a blistering pace with the 4-day project titled 'Benson', named for the New York-based detective on the TV show "Law & Order: SVU". For this project, our teams were assigned the task of figuring out which New York subway stations would be the best places to collect email addresses for promotion of an upcoming Women in Tech Gala.

To do this, we collected data from the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which posts [subway turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) every week.

# Project Design
Our initial approach was to attempt to contact as many people as possible. We considered this to be the safest way to guarantee a large quantity of respondents, even if response rates to email outreach were low. It was fairly straightforward to calculate the total traffic through a station from the MTA dataset -- in most cases, it was as simple as subtracting the initial count of entries or exits on a given day from the final count of entries or exits on that day.
