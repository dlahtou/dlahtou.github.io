title: Metis Week 1 -- Project Benson
---

My first week at Metis started off at a blistering pace with the 4-day project titled 'Benson', named for the New York-based detective on the TV show "Law & Order: SVU". For this project, our teams were assigned the task of figuring out which New York subway stations would be the best places to collect email addresses for promotion of an upcoming Women in Tech Gala.

To do this, we collected data from the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which posts [subway turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) every week.
